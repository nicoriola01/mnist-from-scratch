# MNIST Digit Recognizer
This project is a digit recognizer built with Python. It uses a custom-built neural network from scratch using only NumPy and Pandas, and it features a graphical user interface (GUI) made with Tkinter where 
you can draw a digit and have the model predict what it is.

## Features
- **Interactive GUI**: A simple and intuitive interface to draw digits.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Instantly get a prediction for the digit you've drawn.
- **Confidence Scores**: View the model's confidence for each digit (0-9).
- **Neural Network from Scratch**: The core prediction model is built using only NumPy, providing a clear view of the underlying mechanics.
- **Model Training Script**: Includes a script to train the neural network on the MNIST dataset.

## Setup and installation
### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
### 2. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/nicoriola01/mnist-from-scratch.git
```
### 3. Install dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries. You can install them using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas Pillow tkinter
```
### 4. Download the Dataset
This project uses the MNIST dataset in CSV format.
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle: [MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv)
2. Create a ```datasets``` folder in the root of the project.
3. Place ```mnist_train.csv``` and ```mnist_test.csv``` inside the ```datasets``` folder.

## How to run the application
There are two main steps: training the model and running the GUI.
### Step 1: Train the Model
First, you need to train the neural network. This will create a ```weights.npz``` file which contains the trained parameters for the model.

Run the training script from the root directory:

```python src/training.py```
### Step 2: Launch the GUI Recognizer
After the ```weights.npz``` file has been created, you can run the GUI application.

```python digit_recognizer_functional.py```

The application window will open. You can now draw a digit on the black canvas and click "Predict" to see the result!
## How it works
The core of the project is a simple feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer.
- **Input Layer**: 784 neurons (for a 28x28 pixel image).
- **Hidden Layer**: 128 neurons with the ReLU activation function.
- **Output Layer**: 10 neurons (for digits 0-9) with the Softmax activation function to produce probabilities.

The training process uses gradient descent and backpropagation to adjust the model's weights and biases to minimize the loss on the training data.
